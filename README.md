FactorMiner is a research framework for discovering interpretable alpha factors from market data using a typed DSL, an LLM generation loop, structured memory, and a library admission process built around predictive power and orthogonality.

The implementation is based on *FactorMiner: A Self-Evolving Agent with Skills and Experience Memory for Financial Alpha Discovery* (Wang et al., 2026), with an extended Helix-style Phase 2 surface for canonicalization, knowledge-graph retrieval, debate generation, and deeper post-admission validation.

## What Is In The Repo

- `RalphLoop` for iterative factor mining with retrieval, generation, evaluation, admission, and memory updates
- `HelixLoop` for enhanced Phase 2 mining with debate, canonicalization, retrieval enrichments, and optional post-admission validation
- 110 paper factors shipped in `library_io.py`
- 60+ operators across arithmetic, statistical, time-series, smoothing, cross-sectional, regression, and logical categories
- A parser + expression tree DSL over the canonical feature set:
  `$open`, `$high`, `$low`, `$close`, `$volume`, `$amt`, `$vwap`, `$returns`
- Analysis commands that now recompute signals on the supplied dataset instead of trusting stored library metadata
- Combination and portfolio evaluation utilities
- Visualization and tear sheet generation
- Mock/demo flows for local end-to-end testing without API keys

## Setup

### Recommended: `uv`

FactorMiner now supports a clean `uv` workflow for local development and reproducible setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/minihellboy/factorminer.git
cd factorminer

# Base runtime + dev tools
uv sync --group dev

# Add LLM providers / embedding stack
uv sync --group dev --extra llm

# Full local setup
uv sync --group dev --all-extras
```

Notes:

- The GPU extra is marked Linux-only because `cupy-cuda12x` is not generally installable on macOS.
- `uv sync --group dev --all-extras` is the intended "full environment" path for contributors.
- After syncing, use `uv run ...` for every command shown below.

### `pip` fallback

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
python3 -m pip install -e ".[llm]"
python3 -m pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## Quick Start

### Demo without API keys

```bash
uv run python run_demo.py
```

The demo uses synthetic market data and a mock LLM provider. It explicitly uses synthetic fallback for signal failures so local experiments do not get blocked by strict benchmark behavior.

### CLI overview

```bash
uv run factorminer --help
```

Available commands:

- `mine`: run the Ralph mining loop
- `helix`: run the enhanced Phase 2 Helix loop
- `evaluate`: recompute and score a saved factor library on train/test/full splits
- `combine`: fit a factor subset on one split and evaluate composites on another
- `visualize`: generate recomputed correlation, IC, quintile, and tear sheet outputs
- `export`: export a library as JSON, CSV, or formulas

## Common Workflows

### 1. Mine with mock data

```bash
uv run factorminer --cpu mine --mock -n 2 -b 8 -t 10
```

### 2. Run Helix with selected Phase 2 features

```bash
uv run factorminer --cpu helix --mock --debate --canonicalize -n 2 -b 8 -t 10
```

### 3. Evaluate a saved library with strict recomputation

```bash
uv run factorminer --cpu evaluate output/factor_library.json --mock --period both --top-k 10
```

Behavior:

- Signals are recomputed from formulas on the supplied dataset.
- `train_period` and `test_period` from config define the authoritative split boundaries.
- `--period both` compares the same factor set across train and test and prints a decay summary.

### 4. Combine factors with explicit fit/eval splits

```bash
uv run factorminer --cpu combine output/factor_library.json \
  --mock \
  --fit-period train \
  --eval-period test \
  --method all \
  --selection lasso \
  --top-k 20
```

Behavior:

- top-k selection is based on recomputed fit-split metrics
- optional selection runs on the fit split
- portfolio evaluation runs on the eval split
- no pseudo-signal fallback is used in benchmark-facing analysis paths

### 5. Visualize recomputed artifacts

```bash
uv run factorminer --cpu visualize output/factor_library.json \
  --mock \
  --period test \
  --correlation \
  --ic-timeseries \
  --quintile \
  --tearsheet
```

Behavior:

- correlation heatmaps are built from recomputed factor-factor correlation
- IC plots use actual IC series from recomputed signals
- quintile plots and tear sheets use actual returns, not library-level summary metadata

## Configuration

The default config lives at [`factorminer/configs/default.yaml`](factorminer/configs/default.yaml).

Key top-level fields:

- `data_path`: optional source file path when not using `--data`
- `output_dir`: default output directory for libraries, logs, and plots
- `mining`: Ralph/Helix mining thresholds and loop controls
- `evaluation`: backend, worker count, and strictness policy
- `data`: canonical features plus train/test split windows
- `llm`: provider, model, API key, and sampling settings
- `memory`: experience-memory retention settings
- `phase2`: Helix-specific toggles and validation modules

### Signal failure policy

`evaluation.signal_failure_policy` controls what happens when a factor formula cannot be recomputed:

- `reject`: fail the factor or abort the benchmark path
- `synthetic`: use deterministic pseudo-signals for demo/mock flows
- `raise`: propagate the raw exception for debugging

Defaults:

- analysis commands use `reject`
- `mine --mock`, `helix --mock`, and `run_demo.py` use `synthetic`

### Split semantics

`data.train_period` and `data.test_period` are the source of truth for:

- `evaluate --period train|test|both`
- `combine --fit-period ... --eval-period ...`
- `visualize --period train|test|both`

## Data Format

Input data is expected to contain market bars with at least:

```text
datetime, asset_id, open, high, low, close, volume, amount
```

If `vwap` or `returns` are not present, the runtime layer derives them.

Mock data generation is available through `--mock` and `run_demo.py`.

## Helix / Phase 2

The Helix surface extends the base Ralph loop with additional tooling:

- debate generation via specialist agents
- SymPy canonicalization
- knowledge-graph retrieval
- embedding-assisted retrieval
- auto-inventor hooks
- optional causal, regime, capacity, and significance validation modules

Prompt construction now consumes structured Helix retrieval signals, including:

- complementary patterns
- conflict warnings / saturation warnings
- operator co-occurrence priors
- semantic gaps
- plain-language retrieval summaries

## Analysis Integrity

Recent changes in this repo tightened the benchmark surface:

- `evaluate`, `combine`, and `visualize` now recompute from the supplied dataset
- CLI top-k selection is based on recomputed split metrics
- Helix/Ralph use an explicit signal-failure policy
- mock/demo paths preserve convenience without leaking synthetic fallback into benchmark commands

This means saved library metadata is no longer treated as the final source of truth for analysis.

uv run pytest -q factorminer/tests
```

## Packaging Notes

- The project now uses `setuptools.build_meta` as its build backend.
- `uv` is the recommended local workflow.
- `uv.lock` is generated and should be refreshed when dependency metadata changes.
- The repo metadata points at the current GitHub project: [minihellboy/factorminer](https://github.com/minihellboy/factorminer).
